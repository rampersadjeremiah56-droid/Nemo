            <h2>A Birthday Letter to My Best Friend, Nemo</h2>
            <p>
Nemo,<br><br>
I don’t even know where to start, so I guess I’ll start from the beginning, the day we met on Free Fire. It’s crazy how something so random turned into one of the best parts of my life. We were just in the same guild, playing for fun, and somehow, we ended up playing together almost every day. Then we started calling, making fun of each other, laughing at everything… and honestly, that was the start of our friendship.<br><br>
We moved from the game to WhatsApp, and from that day, everything changed. You became the person I talk to the most, the one I go to when I need company, the one who’s always awake at night (even though you SAY you're going to sleep but then send me a TikTok an hour later, explain that because that’s not the kind of sleeping I know of).<br><br>
And don’t think I forget things. Somehow my brain remembers so much about you… even though I don’t remember the name of your cat right now (I swear my brain blanked; I’ll fix it later 💀). But she’s cute as hell and we both love her.<br><br>
You became my best friend without me even realizing it. And honestly? You’re probably the last best friend I’m ever gonna have. I’m done. No more. I’m keeping you as the final one.<br><br>
You’re joyful, happy, full of life, and you have a beautiful smile.<br>
Your giggle? Weird? Yes?<br>
Do I like it? Yes.<br>
Do I laugh at it? Also, yes.<br>
You’re someone I can count on, day or night. Whenever I need someone, you’re there. Even if you don’t talk about your problems with me (idk if that’s good or bad), I still just want the best for you. I care about you a lot, even if I’m not the best at showing my feelings.<br><br>
When you don’t eat, it actually bothers me. When you put yourself down, it annoys me. When you don’t believe in yourself, it makes me want to shake you like, “BRO WAKE UP YOU’RE AMAZING.”<br><br>
Because listen,<br>
You have so many pros:<br>
You’re joyful, happy, kind (not to me but I still see it), you have a bright smile, elite taste in music, an outstanding and magnificent personality. You’re a crybaby, you love sports, your cat, and Billie. Can’t forget Billieee. You make people laugh, you bring smiles, and you’re someone I’m proud of.<br><br>
Your cons are only because of how you think about yourself:<br>
You don’t believe in yourself<br>
You think you’re fat when you’re not<br>
You base yourself off other people<br>
You’re not proud of yourself<br>
DONT wait for compliments instead give them to yourself, you don’t need someone.<br><br>
But Nemo, you only get ONE life.<br>
Stop comparing yourself to others.<br>
Compare yourself to who you were yesterday and grow from that.<br>
Trust yourself.<br>
Believe in yourself.<br>
Be proud of yourself.<br>
You deserve that.<br><br>
Right now, my life isn’t going that great, and I don’t tell people these things, not even you. But forget that. This time is all about you.<br>
Your birthday.<br>
Your happiness.<br>
Your smile.<br>
Your life.<br><br>
I don’t know what gifts you’re expecting, but I hope you get everything you want even seeing Billie.<br>
I can’t give you much right now, but I can give you this letter, this website, my time, and the fact that you’re the second person on my mind always.<br><br>
From December 2nd to the 12th, I’ll be busy with exams, so I might not be able to spend as much time with you. But I promise I’ll find a way to get at least one day to spend with you properly. Don’t worry, I always find a way.<br><br>
I hope your birthday and your Christmas are filled with nothing but joy, happiness, and only happy tears. I don’t wanna see you crying for anything sad.<br><br>
Happy birthday, Nemo.<br>
Thank you for being my best friend.<br>
Thank you for being you.<br><br>
- Jeremiah
